## About COVID-19 in Charts
This website uses the [data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This data isn't perfect, for that reason, I wouldn't recommend using this website in any official manner.

## Running the app
This application was developed in React.

To run the application, use:

```
yarn start

OR

npm start
```

Afterwards, you should be able to view the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
