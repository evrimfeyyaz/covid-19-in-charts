## COVID-19 in Charts
This is the source code for the [COVID-19 in Charts](https://covid19incharts.com) website.

The codebase is currently somewhat messy. If you are interested in helping, I would appreciate help with any of the following:

1. Accessibility.
2. Design.
3. Testing.
4. New chart ideas and implementations.

## About COVID-19 in Charts
I created this website to help people see the COVID-19 data in a visual way, and give everyone a way to easily create shareable images of these visualizations.

This website uses the [data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This data isn't perfect, so, I wouldn't recommend using this website in any official manner.

## Running the app
This application was developed in React.

To run the application, use:

```
yarn start

OR

npm start
```

Afterwards, you should be able to visit the app at http://localhost:3000.

## Looking for a web or mobile app developer?
